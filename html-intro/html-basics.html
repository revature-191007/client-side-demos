        <!-- HTML is a semantic language. The tags are intended to define
        the semantic meaning of the content. So we should always choose
        tags based on what best defines the content, not what style of
        content we prefer. Styling should be done through CSS. -->

        <p>Formatting of the              XML
                                 document does
            not mean that the
            HTML                    content will
            have the same formatting
        </p>

        <pre>The pre tag
                allows us to provide preformatted
                        text for
situations where               we don't want HTML
                    to change our text formatting.
        </pre>

        <code>The code tag is used to represent code.</code>

        <span>Span is usually used as a container, but could
            also be used for text. Span is a non-semantic element.
            Choose a different element if there are ones that better
            match the semantic meaning of the content.
